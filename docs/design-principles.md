# Software Design Principles

Our software design follows these core principles across all projects.

## Clean Architecture

We structure our applications using Clean Architecture principles:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business entities, value objects, domain services
- **Application Layer**: Contains use cases, orchestrates domain objects
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements interfaces defined by the application
- **Interface Layer**: UI, API controllers, and other entry points

Dependencies always point inward, with domain at the center.

## SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one reason to change
2. **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
4. **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces over one general interface
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Rust-Specific Design

- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use traits for polymorphism
- Follow the type-driven development approach
- Leverage Rust's ownership model for resource management
- Use Result for error handling, not exceptions

## Functional Programming Concepts

- Minimize mutable state
- Use pure functions where possible
- Use higher-order functions for reusable behavior
- Leverage Rust's iterators and closures
