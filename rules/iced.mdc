description: when using Iced.rs
globs:

Our UI is Iced.rs
We use version 0.13.1
this should be the only version specified in Cargo.toml unless changed here.

here is the latest documentation @https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/

adhere to this official documentation over syntactic sugar offered from 3rd parties.

when looking at examples on the web, always take the vesion into context. examples get outdated quickly and may need to follow a migration path.

This is especially important for things like Fonts which APIs have changed since v0.12. We adhere to this: @https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/font/index.html
