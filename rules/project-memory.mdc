suggestions:
  - when: "starting_project"
    suggest: |
      1. Create projectBrief.md first
      2. Create projectContext.md based on brief
      3. Create systemPatterns.md for architecture
      4. Create techContext.md for environment
      5. Create domainContext.md for current state
      6. Create progress.md to track status
      7. Wait for user input before proceeding

  - when: "updating_memory"
    suggest: |
      1. Review ALL memory bank files
      2. Update domainContext.md with changes
      3. Update progress.md with status
      4. Update related documentation
      5. Verify hierarchy consistency

  - when: "changing_modes"
    suggest: |
      1. Document current mode completion
      2. Update progress.md with status
      3. Document new mode requirements
      4. Wait for explicit mode change
      5. Update domainContext.md

  - when: "adding_context"
    suggest: |
      1. Create in appropriate doc/ subfolder
      2. Link to parent documentation
      3. Follow memory bank hierarchy
      4. Update related core files
      5. Document in progress.md
