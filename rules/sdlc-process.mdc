# Software Development Lifecycle Process

Our team follows a modified waterfall approach incorporating Domain Driven Design (DDD), event storming, and event modeling. This file outlines our process from idea to deployment.

## Lifecycle Stages

1. **Project Planning**
   - Product Owner defines vision and priorities
   - Project Manager creates timeline and resource allocation
   - Business Analyst helps identify business objectives

2. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Business Analyst documents functional requirements
   - Product Owner ensures alignment with user needs
   - AI Prompt Engineer identifies AI integration opportunities

3. **System Design**
   - Software Architect leads design using DDD principles
   - Team conducts event storming sessions
   - Event modeling is used to design and document the system
   - Creation of bounded contexts and ubiquitous language

4. **Development**
   - Senior Developer implements core functionalities
   - AI Prompt Engineer creates prompts and integrates AI capabilities
   - Implementation follows the domain model established in design
   - Code organization reflects bounded contexts

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for domain logic
   - Integration tests for bounded contexts
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows

6. **Deployment**
   - NixOS-based deployment
   - Containerization when appropriate
   - Configuration management through Nix

7. **Maintenance and Support**
   - Ongoing monitoring
   - Bug fixes and enhancements
   - Regular reviews of system performance
